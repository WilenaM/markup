            <h2>What is Scrum?</h2>
            <p>Scrum is an agile project management framework designed to help teams develop and deliver high-quality
                products efficiently. Originally developed in the 1990s, Scrum has since found applications across
                various
                industries, not just in software development but also in marketing, finance, and even healthcare.</p>
            <h3>Benefits of Scrum</h3>
            <p>Scrum offers numerous advantages for organizations:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong>Scrum adapts to changing requirements, making it well-suited for
                    projects with evolving scopes.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer-Centric:</strong>By involving the Product Owner and focusing on delivering value,
                    Scrum ensures that the product aligns with customer needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong>Daily standups, Sprint Reviews, and other Scrum ceremonies keep
                    everyone informed about project progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Quality:</strong>Continuous testing and integration practices result in higher-quality
                    products.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong>Sprints encourage teams to work in short, focused bursts, reducing waste
                    and increasing productivity.</li>
